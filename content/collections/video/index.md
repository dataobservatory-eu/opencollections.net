Our `Open Video Collections` store digital videosâ€”`born digital` items and `digital surrogates` of analogue footage, catalogue them to a high standard, and connect them to locations, buildings, people and other things via linked open data (semantic web) techniques.  Whenever possible, we aim to make a preview (low resolution) or a high-resolution digital copy available. 

- [x] Video as documentation for other music, film, folklore, architecture or other collections.
- [x] Private movies
- [x] Short films, documentaries
- [x] Early and historic moving images
