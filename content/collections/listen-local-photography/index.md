The `Listen Local Photography Collection` is a part of our [Open Photography Collection](https://www.opencollections.net/collections/photography/). It is mainly, however, a supporting collection of our [Open Music Collection](https://www.opencollections.net/collections/music/), particularly that of the Listen Local Music programme. This is an ongoing project.

The aim of the collection:

- Document contemporary and historic music scenes and ecosystems.
- Provide at least one [Free Cultural Works](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/freeworks/) for encyclopedias, music resources, blogs, website about artists, musicians, musicologists and key persons in music scenes.
- Aim to include some high quality works of photographers to promote portrait and stage photography.

See the [Listen Local Photography Project](https://www.opencollections.net/project/listen-local-photography/).
