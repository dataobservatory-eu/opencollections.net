{{% callout note %}}
Our `Open Photography Collections` store digital photographs—`born digital` items and `digital surrogates` of analogue prints, slides or negatives—, catalogue them to a high standard, and connect them to locations, buildings, people and other things via linked open data (semantic web) techniques.  Whenever possible, we aim to make a preview (low resolution) or a high-resolution digital copy available.
